        <p>Is it that time of year already? Before we get started, please <strong>be careful and ready everything before continuing</strong>. Some actions taken in the next few steps can be detrimental if followed in the middle of the year. Once you are ready to proceed, click 'Begin' below.</p>

        <p>This is the scary part. In order to get everything ready for next year, we need to clear everyone from Active status and then clear the housing board. Once we get a fresh start, we will forward you onto the housing page to fill out the new housing board.</p>

        <p>Take a second and scroll down the list, remove anyone who has graduated. Anyone in this list who is in good standing can become active, so it is important it is correct.</p>

        <p>The next and final step is to go through and populate the housing board; the button below will even take you there. Just a note: adding people will automatically mark them as active, since they will be charged dues.</p>
