Conditional
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ComputerScienceHouse/conditional.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ComputerScienceHouse/conditional)

A comprehensive membership evaluations solution for Computer Science House.

Development
-----------

To run the application, you must have the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed. Once you have those installed, create a new virtualenv and install the Python dependencies:

```
virtualenv .conditionalenv -p `which python3`
source .conditionalenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```

In addition, you must have Node, NPM, and Gulp CLI installed to properly execute the asset pipeline. If you don't have Node installed, we recommending installing with [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm):

```
nvm install
nvm use
npm install -g gulp
```

Then, install the pipeline and frontend dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Config

You must create `config.py` in the top-level directory with the appropriate credentials for the application to run. See `config.sample.py` for an example.

#### Add OIDC Config
Reach out to an RTP to get OIDC credentials that will allow you to develop locally behind OIDC auth
```
# OIDC Config
OIDC_ISSUER = "https://sso.csh.rit.edu/auth/realms/csh"
OIDC_CLIENT_CONFIG = {
    'client_id': '',
    'client_secret': '',
    'post_logout_redirect_uris': ['http://0.0.0.0:6969/logout']
}
```

### Run

Once you have all of the dependencies installed, simply run:

```
npm start
```

This will run the asset pipeline, start the Python server, and start BrowserSync. Your default web browser will open automatically. If it doesn't, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Any changes made to the frontend files in `frontend` or the Jinja templates in `conditional/templates` will cause the browser to reload automatically.

### Dependencies

To add new dependencies, add them to `requirements.in` and then run `pip-compile requirements.in` to produce a new locked `requirements.txt`. Do not edit `requirements.txt` directly as it will be overwritten by future PRs.

### Database Migrations

If the database schema is changed after initializing the database, you must migrate it to the new schema by running:

```
flask db upgrade
```

At the same time, if you change the database schema, you must generate a new migration by running:

```
flask db migrate
```

The new migration script in `migrations/versions` should be verified before being committed, as Alembic may not detect every change you make to the models.

For more information, refer to the [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/) documentation.

### Old Evals DB Migration

Conditional includes a utility to facilitate data migrations from the old Evals DB. This isn't necessary to run Conditional. To perform this migration, run the following commands before starting the application:

```
pip install pymysql
flask zoo
```
